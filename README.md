# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed during my software trainee program with Amalitech. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and serves as a base for further exploration and enhancements.

## Features
- **Two-player mode**: Interactive gameplay between two users.
- **CPU mode**: Option to play against the computer.
- **Win detection logic**: Automatically determines and announces the winner or declares a draw.
- **Basic user interface**: Console-based interaction, ensuring simplicity and ease of use.

## File Structure

Hereâ€™s how the files are organized:

### Project Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the game interface.
- **main.js**: Contains the game logic and functionalities for Tic-Tac-Toe.
- **styles**: 
  - *styles/*: Folder containing the CSS files for game design and styling.
  
### Assets
- **assets/**: Folder with additional files, images, or resources used in the project.

### Additional Files
- **README.md**: Provides a detailed overview of the project.
- **.gitattributes**: Configuration file for managing repository attributes.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Choose between two-player mode or CPU mode.
3. Players take turns to enter their moves, with the game automatically updating the board.
4. The game ends by announcing the winner or a draw.

## Future Enhancements
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Implement a more interactive and visually appealing interface.
- **Replay Option**: Add a feature allowing players to restart the game without refreshing the page.
- **Game Statistics**: Track win/loss statistics for each player.
- **Code Optimization**: Refactor the code for better scalability and maintainability.
