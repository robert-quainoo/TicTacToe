Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game created during my software trainee program with Amalitech. It serves as a demonstration of fundamental programming concepts and serves as a starting point for further exploration and improvement.

Features
Two-player mode for interactive gameplay.
Basic console-based interface for easy interaction.
Win detection logic to determine the game's outcome.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

Enter player choose sides at the beginning of the game.
Players take turns entering their moves on the game board.
The game declares the winner or a draw when the game concludes.
Future Enhancements
This project can be expanded and improved in several ways:

Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Add additional features such as a replay option or game statistics.
Optimize the code structure for scalability and maintainability.
